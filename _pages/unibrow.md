<h1>Unibrow's Family</h1>

Unibrow is a large goose with distinctive white marks on his forehead. For this reason, we think he is actually a giant maximus Canada Goose. He is known for his soft "ohn ohn" call. He is also very friendly with humans, which only Gooserino can rival. For some reason I cannot explain, he looks like a Quetzalcoatlus.

We initially noticed him with Leader's group in 2018/2019, as Leader's right-hand-man. But while Leader and even Lonely both surpassed his status when they had children, we still had hopes for Unibrow.

In the spring of 2021, he had three children.

Then, in the spring of 2023, he had six children. The following week, he had four. The week after that, he had five. We have no clue what is going on.
