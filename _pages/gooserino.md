On February 23rd, 2018, we noticed a particular goose making this weird honking/wahh-ing noise at another goose that we speculated to be the spouse.

However, on September 3rd, 2018, we see the same goose, though we didn’t know it was the same goose at the time, standing alone at the apartments. We nicknamed the goose, “Lonely”, because they were standing around being alone. Upon closer inspection, we realized that Lonely had missing neck feathers, most likely from a possible attack by a predator. We felt bad for him too, since management kept chasing him out. He has a signature droopy left wing.

We had wanted him to be friendly with Apple Goose and tried to get them closer. Unfortunately, we didn't know at that time that that would cause Apple Goose to think his territory was being intruded on, and would go chase Gooserino.

On September 8th, 2018, however, we found Lonely, who we had also started calling Gooserino at the time, at Tony’s. Gooserino had joined Leader’s group, and had gone to the bottom of the goose social hierarchy.

During all of January of 2019, Gooserino had disappeared for a month… We thought he would be done for from the polar vortex that year.

However, in summer of 2019, Gooserino reappeared, this time with three kids! Unfortunately, we had mistaken Gooserino for a new goose and called him Droopy. This was due to the fact that we didn't believe he could find a partner and have kids. Gooserino also had become really aggressive and had even chased Unibrow, who was Leader's right-hand-man back when both of them were in Leader's group. However, even with his new found courage from his kids, Gooserino still didn’t have the nerve to chase Leader. Speaking of his kids, Gooserino had begun to teach his kids how to make his signature, “wahhhh”, sound. Sometimes, we can recognize Lonely based solely on his "wahh", even though his physical characteristics are some of the most unique for a goose, including his droopy wing, triangle chin strap, and giant forehead.

His kids were the most comfortale with humans out of the dozens of goslings that year. I'd like to think that it is because Gooserino remembers the kindness we showed him at his lowest.

In the summer of 2020, Gooserino molts at the lake, still with his kids, though he is not as close to them anymore.

In the summer of 2022, we saw a dead gosling next to him. He also looked horrible.

In the summer of 2023, we saw him and his partner at the docks. Maybe his wife tried to lay eggs on the boat? Unfortunately, he did not have kids this year.
