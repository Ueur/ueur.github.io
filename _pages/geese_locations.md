<h2>
Lake Arlington
</h2>

The main place to see geese. Ranges from 5 to 50+ goslings each spring and a favorite molting spot for basically all the geese we know.

<h2>
Tony's Parking Lot
</h2>

Standard parking lot. Three species of birds love to congregate here: pigeons, seagulls, and geese. A favorite of Apple Goose's family. Wavy, who followed Apple Goose after her parents kicked her out, is seen trying to get into the dental place.

<h2>
Apartments
</h2>

Large field in this place, which is surrounded by smaller homes. Leader's group is commonly seen here. But Apple Goose used to go here a lot too. Here is Apple Goose's son Nerd Goose staring at me while his flock walks away. When he realized that, he let out a honk, which another goose answered back to tell him that they're still here.
