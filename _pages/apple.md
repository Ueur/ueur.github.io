<h1>Apple Goose's Family</h1>

Spring of 2018, we saw two goslings at the lake. This was the first time we saw goslings. As they matured, they joined up with another family that had three goslings. Despite having less goslings, the one with two were dominant. That year was strange since these five were the only kids. This allowed us to get to know each one better.

For instance, Apple Goose got his name because an apple chunk landed on his head. You can also tell him by his B-shaped chinstrap, as well as his curved and long neck. His honk is very high-pitched as well.

His daughter is named Little Aggressive.
His son is named Nerd. He looks quite similar to Apple Goose with the long neck.

The other family with three goslings were called "family friend". The father liked standing on rocks. The kids were Wavy, Sawblade, and another gosling that sadly disappeared. They all have wavy chinstraps.

March of 2019, we saw Apple Goose chase his kids all the way across the lake. It was evident he was trying for kids again. We even suspected he had kids previously, since another goose would circle us when we played Apple Goose's distinct honk. That means as of 2023, he is at least 8 years old. Anyway, in 2019, he did not have kids, whereas family friend had five goslings. Apple Goose gave up and accepted his kids back again, along with Wavy and Sawblade. They formed the Apple Goose flock.

We caught Apple Goose at his peak. Since then, he has lost status. That's okay. He is special to us because of all the memories of him flying to where we lived at 7AM and waking us up with loud honks. He also said goodbye to us the day we moved out.

When he is scared, he does what other geese do when scared, which is their necks get really thick. We call it "llamified"

This is him in June 2022 at the rear. His wife is leading the way. I'm not sure who is in the middle.
