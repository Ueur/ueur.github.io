On February 23rd, 2018, we noticed a particular goose making this weird honking/wahh-ing noise at another goose that we speculated to be the spouse.

However, on September 3rd, 2018, we see the same goose, though we didn’t know it was the same goose at the time, standing alone at the apartments. We nicknamed the goose, “Lonely”, because they were standing around being alone. Upon closer inspection, we realized that Lonely had missing neck feathers, most likely from a possible attack by a predator.

On September 8th, 2018, however, we found Lonely, who we had also started calling Gooserino at the time, at Tony’s. Gooserino had joined Leader’s group, and had gone to the bottom of the goose social hierarchy.

During all of January of 2019, Gooserino had disappeared for a month…

However, in summer of 2019, Gooserino reappeared, this time with kids! Unfortunately, we had mistaken Gooserino for Apple Goose, or called him Droopy. This was due to the fact that we had thought that Gooserino was a completely different goose, despite the fact that the goose had the same droopy wing, hence the nickname, “Droopy”. Gooserino also had become really aggressive and had even chased Big Brows, and Unibrow, a once trusted ally. However, even with his new found courage from his kids, Gooserino still didn’t have the nerve to chase Leader. Speaking of his kids, Gooserino had begun to teach his kids how to make his signature, “wahhhh”, sound.

In summer of 2020, Gooserino molts at the lake, still with his kids, though he is not as close to them anymore. We often recognize him by his unique, “wahhhhhh”, as opposed to his droopy wing.
