<h1>Leader's Family</h1>

Leader is possibly the most well-connected goose. His appearance, however, is kind of unremarkable. He has a boxy head, and he loves hissing. He has a certain level of distrust for humans.

His wife is named Wife, and they were inseperable, so we also called them couple goose. Someone also called her Sandy's goose, so that means Leader is Sandy's goose's husband. Wife is small for a goose. She also has deep sunken eyes. She is also very bold and doesn't care if Leader tries to control her behavior.

The timeline is that during the Winter of 2019, we started noticing a group of geese that would hang out at the apartments. Two particular geese would boss around the rest, but they would all stay as a group regardless. These two geese were not very remarkable looking, but they were inseparable, so we called them Couple Geese. We thought that wasnâ€™t good enough so we suggested The Shapes, for the ganderâ€™s boxy chinstrap and head. But soon, we settled on the names Leader and Wife.


Like I mentioned, Leader and Wife were not the most striking geese, as their group included the very conspicuous Gooserino/Lonely and Unibrow. Leaderâ€™s group was comprised solely of non-goslings. As such, they were bossed around by Apple Gooseâ€™s 2019 group the rare days they came to the apartments. Other members include Little Brows, Gussy (with a wing outline), Gooserini (Little Browsâ€™ small wife, who is even smaller than Wife), and some other unidentifiable geese.


March of 2019, we noticed that Leader kicked out most of his gang. But we saw Unibrow also in the area. Leader and Wife were honking up a storm and charged at Unibrow and his wife twenty feet away. They tag-teamed chased him in a circle. Thatâ€™s brutal!
    
Some other time this month, we noticed Leader by himself on the sidewalk. Little did we know, he was honking up at his wife on the roof.

In April 2019, we saw him with four goslings. 

A little time later, we noticed two of Leaderâ€™s own goses disappeared. However, he got a new one, an adopted one. They were smaller than the rest, so we named them Tiny Gos. Tiny was really absentminded, and he had a lopsided face.

Before Tiny grew in blue tubes for their adult feathers, they and one sibling disappeared! They were last seen near the woods.

Leader and Wife had one gos left.

Sometimes, that singular gos would hang out with Gooserinoâ€™s three goses. Probably knew that Gooserino is a responsible father.

That last gos also was found tangled in some fishing line. Please pick up your litter ðŸ˜¦

Luckily, we untangled them, otherwise Leader would have lost not only the first two from his original group of four, but also Tiny and the other two! What a disgrace, Leader.

By the end of February, Leader and Wife had already kicked out their last gos and were hanging out at the apartments again (or lost that last gos without us noticing). We wonder if that last gos hanged out with Gooserinoâ€™s 2019 children while they tried for another group of kids.

They had five kids the spring of 2020.

Because of the pandemic, Lake Arlington was closed for a while, so the babies have grown big the next time we saw them. Luckily, Leader didnâ€™t lose any in the meanwhile.

The other geese in the lake did not have as many goses as Leader, so he and his Wife became the dominant group.They would often lead the families with goses in a mega-flock of about 30 geese near the lake.

Since we moved away, it has been harder to spot Leader and Wife, partly because they don't have that much distinctive features.
