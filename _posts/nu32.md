This is the second to last project of the course MECH_ENG_333, which I took in the winter of 2021. It uses C, PuTTY, and MATLAB to use feedback control to alter the brightness of an LED. This project uses counter/timer, output compare, and analog input peripherals, as well as the parallel master port for the LCD screen. The sensor that measures the brightness of the LED tracks the desired brightness, as shown by the square waves in MATLAB in the demo video, demonstrating that the feedback control is successful.

It is coded in C, and the PIC32 microcontroller is wired to generate a pulse-width modulation waveform that serves as the reference in which the brightness of the LED emulates. The efficacy of this feedback control is measured by a photoelectric sensor, communicated to the computer via PuTTY, and plotted in MATLAB. Feedback control is used in many technologies, from adjusting the temperature on the thermostat to the speed on a car.
